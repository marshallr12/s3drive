# Phased implementation plan

Each phase must leave a buildable tree, explicit behavior contract and durable
verification evidence. P0 is the current delivery. No target provider or native
mounted filesystem has been tested yet.

| Phase | Deliverable | Completion evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P0 — research and scaffold | This book, workspace, local CLI, SQLite bootstrap, private Git repository | Local gate passes; pushed source matches local commit; repository privacy verified |
| P1 — provider contract | Read-only S3 client, bounded list/head/range APIs, source identity, error model and provider evidence records | Deterministic HTTP contract tests plus an explicitly selected test bucket/provider; pagination, signed requests, exact ranges and revisions verified |
| P2 — Linux read-only drive | Shared namespace engine and FUSE callbacks | Real mount; directory traversal and random/sequential reads match remote bytes; no mutation calls; clean unmount and cancellation |
| P3 — Windows read-only drive | WinFsp binding decision and Windows adapter reusing P2 core | Native MSVC build and Windows runtime tests; Explorer/PowerShell access; stable names/handles and clean removal |
| P4 — cache and local recovery | Revision-aware disk cache, eviction, pinning, single-process ownership, state migrations | Cache isolation, disk-full, stale revision, offline miss and restart tests; no dirty data exists yet |
| P5a — staged writes | In-memory storage test double plus immutable local generations and durable journal | Fault injection at every local boundary; acknowledged local state survives restart; network mutation remains disabled |
| P5b — conditional remote commits | Create/replace and multipart recovery; explicit flush contract | Provider preconditions verified; two-writer conflict tests; crash/timeout replay never overwrites unseen edits |
| P5c — desktop mutations | Safe delete, documented rename behavior, open-handle semantics, real application workflows | Delete races, save/replace, concurrent open, unmount failures and data-loss tests on both OSes |
| P6 — user application | Diagnostics, per-user startup, signed packaging/update process, optional tray UI | Clean-machine install/uninstall, missing-driver handling, upgrade/recovery, user-visible status |

## P1 concrete tasks

1. Select the first provider and dedicated test bucket/prefix. Add AWS SDK client
   setup with explicit per-source endpoint/region/addressing/profile precedence.
   Pin and inspect resolved APIs. Keep credentials out of fixtures.
2. Establish a storage error taxonomy and streaming/cancellation contract.
   Build deterministic tests for transport errors, authorization versus missing,
   pagination tokens, range lengths and response validators.
3. Implement a bounded list/head/range spike. Include empty objects, Unicode,
   literal percent characters, folder markers, `a` versus `a/b`, and multiple
   pages. Preserve remote key bytes and reject ambiguous OS projections.
4. Design source IDs/config fingerprints and invalidate old cached metadata on
   reconfiguration. Migrate P0's reserved table before it stores live data.
5. Record provider facts as `unknown`, `unsupported`, or `verified`, with endpoint,
   bucket type, software version where known, test version, timestamp and scope.
   A successful GET cannot establish conditional-write support.

Mutating capability probes require a dedicated disposable prefix and explicit
test configuration; they must not run automatically during a read-only mount.
Never test collision or overwrite behavior on ordinary user objects.

## Test matrix

| Layer | Required scenarios | Where it runs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pure Rust | Path containment, key identity, case collisions, handle lifetime, state machines | Linux and Windows CI |
| SQLite/cache | Migration, restart, full disk, process ownership, file/DB ordering | Native local disk tests |
| HTTP adapter | Malformed/error responses, pagination, partial reads, cancellation, uncertain completion | Deterministic local test server |
| Provider | AWS S3 general-purpose bucket plus the user's actual compatible provider | Isolated opted-in test buckets |
| Linux mount | Kernel callbacks, large trees, concurrent reads, signals and unmount | Linux host with `/dev/fuse` |
| Windows mount | WinFsp callbacks, sharing, names, Explorer, security and teardown | Windows host/VM with driver |
| Recovery | Kill/restart at every durability boundary, external writer, credentials expired | Fault-injection runner with isolated objects |
| Desktop compatibility | Real open/edit/save/replace sequences in chosen applications | Both OSes in P5c |

Use an emulator for deterministic behavior, not as proof of all provider
semantics. An AWS-only pass does not certify third-party S3 support. Keep a
provider/OS support matrix containing actual versions and evidence locations.

## Stop conditions for mutations

Keep writable mounts disabled if conditional operations are unavailable or
unverified, if staging cannot guarantee the selected local durability, or if
the recovery journal cannot identify an uncertain outcome. Direct-mode rename
must remain unsupported unless its limitations and concurrency behavior are
deliberate and tested. Full distributed filesystem semantics require a revised
architecture, not a flag labeled “POSIX compatible.”

The first usable product milestone is **P3: read-only mounts on both platforms**.
A general editable desktop drive requires P5c, while a Google Drive-like
polished application also needs P6. Choose Cloud Files instead of the P3 WinFsp
surface only after resolving the drive-versus-sync-folder product preference.
